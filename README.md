# Feature Engineering & Predictive Analysis

This data modeling project is for Apprentice Chef - an innovative startup who recently had a cross promotion partnership with Half Way There (wine company) to diversify it's menue and get more sources of revenue.

## Goal
Develop top insights and build  a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to the cross selling promotion partnership with Half Way There.

## Solving the Problem:
I explored the dataset and did some feature engineering to help me with my regression analysis. I tried different models to predict what variables are correlated to the CROSS SELL SUCCESS to give me a better understanding of they type of customers who are more likely to avail the promotion.

## Overview of the Dataset:
I've uploaded a file named Apprentice Chef Dictionary

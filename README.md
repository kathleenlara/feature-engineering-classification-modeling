# Machine Learning Models

This data modeling project is for Apprentice Chef - an innovative startup.

## Goal
Develop top insights and build  a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to the cross selling promotion partnership with Half Way There.

## Solving the Problem:
I explored the dataset and did some feature engineering to help me with my regression analysis. I tried different models to predict what variables are correlated to the REVENUE and can give me a better prediction of what to expect from each customer.

## Overview of the Dataset:
I've uploaded a file named Apprentice Chef Dictionary

## Overview of the Process
- Data Exploration
- Feature Engineering
- Building a Base Model
- OLS Regression
- ARD 
- LASSO
- KNN
